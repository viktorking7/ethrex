## Importing blocks

The simplest task a node can do is import blocks offline. We would do so like this:

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you've read the dev [installation guide](../installing.md)

## Import blocks

```bash
# Execute the import
# Notice that the .rlp file is stored with Git LFS, it needs to be downloaded before importing
ethrex --network fixtures/genesis/perf-ci.json import  fixtures/blockchain/l2-1k-erc20.rlp
```

- The network argument is common to all ethrex commands. It specifies the genesis file, or a public network like holesky. This is the starting state of the blockchain.
- The import command means that this node will not start rpc endpoints or peer to peer communication. It will just read a file, parse the blocks, execute them, and save the EVM state (accounts info and storage) after each execution.
- The file is an RLP encoded file with a list of blocks.

### Block execution

The CLI import subcommand executes `cmd/ethrex/cli.rs:import_blocks`, which can be summarized as:

```rust
let store = init_store(&datadir, network).await;
let blockchain = init_blockchain(evm, store.clone());
for block in parse(rlp_file) {
    blockchain.add_block(block)
}
```

The blockchain struct is our main point of interaction with our data. It contains references to key structures like our store (key-value db) and the EVM engine (knows how to execute transactions).

Adding a block is performed in `crates/blockchain/blockchain.rs:add_block`, and performs several tasks:

1. Block execution (`execute_block`).
   1. Pre-validation. Checks that the block parent is present, that the base fee matches the parent's expectations, timestamps, header number, transaction root and withdrawals root.
   2. VM execution. The block contains all the transactions, which is all needed to perform a state transition. The VM has a reference to the store, so it can get the current state to apply transactions on top of it.
   3. Post execution validations: gas used, receipts root, requests hash.
   4. The VM execution does not mutate the store itself. It returns a list of all changes that happened in execution so they can be applied in any custom way.
2. Post-state storage (`store_block`)
   1. `apply_account_updates` gets the pre-state from the store, applies the updates to get an updated post-transition-state, calculates the root and commits the new state to disk.
   2. The state root is a merkle root, a cryptographic summary of a state. The one we just calculated is compared with the one in the block header. If it matches, it proves that your node's post-state is the same as the one the block producer reached after executing that same block.
   3. The block and the receipts are saved to disk.

### States

In ethereum the first state is determined by the genesis file. After that, each block represents a state transition. To be formal about it, if we have a state $S$ and a block $B$, we can define $B' = f(S,B)$ as the application of a state transition function.

This means that a blockchain, internally, looks like this.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Sg["Sg (genesis)"]
    S1a["S1"]
    S2a["S2"]
    S3a["S3"]

    Sg -- "f(Sg, B1)" --> S1a
    S1a -- "f(S1, B2)" --> S2a
    S2a -- "f(S2, B3)" --> S3a
```

We start from a genesis state, and each time we add a block we generate a new state. We don't only save the current state ($S_3$), we save all of them in the DB after execution. This seems wasteful, but the reason will become more obvious very soon. This means that we can get the state for any block number. We say that if we get the state for block number one, we actually are getting the state right after applying `B1`.

Due to the highly available nature of ethereum, sometimes multiple different blocks can be proposed for a single state. This creates what we call "soft forks".

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Sg["Sg (genesis)"]
    S1a["S1"]
    S2a["S2"]
    S3a["S3"]
    S1b["S1'"]
    S2b["S2'"]
    S3b["S3'"]

    Sg -- "f(Sg, B1)" --> S1a
    S1a -- "f(S1, B2)" --> S2a
    S2a -- "f(S2, B3)" --> S3a

    Sg -- "f(Sg, B1')" --> S1b
    S1b -- "f(S1', B2')" --> S2b
    S2b -- "f(S2', B3')" --> S3b
```

This means that for a single block number we actually have different post-states, depending on which block we executed. In turn, this means that using a block number is not a reliable way of getting a state. To fix this, what we do is calculate the hash of a block, which is unique, and use that as an identifier for both the block and its corresponding block state. In that way, if I request the DB the state for `hash(B1)` it understands that I'm looking for `S1`, whereas if I request the DB the state for `hash(B1')` I'm looking for `S1'`.

How we determine which is the right fork is called **Fork choice**, which is not done by the execution client, but by the consensus client. What concerns us is that if we currently think we are on `S3` and the consensus client notifies us that actually `S3'` is the current fork, we need to change our current state to that one. That means that we need to save every post-state in case we need to change forks. This changing of the nodes perception of the correct soft fork to a different one is called **reorg**.

### VM - State interaction

As mentioned in the previous point, the VM execution doesn't directly mutate the store. It just calculates all necessary updates. There's an important clarification we need to go through about the starting point for that calculation.

This is a key piece of code in `Blockchain.execute_block`:

```rust
let vm_db = StoreVmDatabase::new(self.storage.clone(), parent_header)?;
let mut vm = Evm::new(vm_db);
let execution_result = vm.execute_block(block)?;
let account_updates = vm.get_state_transitions()?;
```

The VM is a transient object. It is created with an engine/backend (LEVM or REVM) and a db reference. It is discarded after executing each block.

The `StoreVmDatabase` is just an implementation of the `VmDatabase` trait, using our `Store` (reference to a key-value store). It's an adapter between the store and the vm and allows the VM to not depend on a concrete DB.

The main piece of context a VM DB needs to be created is the `parent_hash`, which is the hash of the parent's block. As we mentioned previously, this hash uniquely identifies an ethereum state, so we are basically telling the VM what it's pre-state is. If we give it that, plus the block, the VM can execute the state-transition function $S' = f(S, B)$ previously mentioned.

The `VmDatabase` context just requires the implementation of the following methods:

```rust
fn get_account_info(&self, address: Address) -> Result<Option<AccountInfo>, EvmError>;
fn get_storage_slot(&self, address: Address, key: H256) -> Result<Option<U256>, EvmError>;
fn get_block_hash(&self, block_number: u64) -> Result<H256, EvmError>;
fn get_chain_config(&self) -> Result<ChainConfig, EvmError>;
fn get_account_code(&self, code_hash: H256) -> Result<Bytes, EvmError>;
```

That is, it needs to know how to get information about accounts, about storage, get a block hash according to a specific number, get the config, and the account code for a specific hash.

Internally, the `StoreVmDatabase` implementation just calls the db for this. For example:

```rust
fn get_account_info(&self, address: Address) -> Result<Option<AccountInfo>, EvmError> {
    self.store
        .get_account_info_by_hash(self.block_hash, address)
        .map_err(|e| EvmError::DB(e.to_string()))
}
```

You may note that the `get_account_info_by_hash` receives not only the address, but also the block hash. That is because it doesn't get the account state for the "current" state, it gets it for the post-state of the parent block. That is, the pre-state for the state transition. And this makes sense: we don't want to apply a transaction anywhere, we want to apply it precisely on top of the parent's state, so that's where we'll be getting all of our state.

### What is state anyway

The ethereum state is, logically, two things: accounts and their storage slots. If we were to represent them in memory, they would be something like:

```rust
pub struct VmState {
    accounts: HashMap<H256, Option<AccountState>>,
    storage: HashMap<H256, HashMap<H256, Option<U256>>>,
}
```

The accounts are indexed by the hash of their address. The storage has a two level lookup: an index by account address hash, and then an index by hashed slot. The reason why we use hashes of the addresses and slots instead of using them directly is an implementation detail.

This flat key-value representation is what we usually call a snapshot. To write and get state, it would be enough and efficient to have a table in the db with some snapshot in the past and then the differences in each account and storage each block. These are precisely the account updates, and this is precisely what we do in our snapshots implementation.

However, we also need to be able to efficiently summarize a state, which is done using a structure called the Merkle Patricia Trie (MPT). This is a big topic, not covered by this document. A link to an in-detail document will be added soon. The most important part of it is that it's a merkle tree and we can calculate its root/hash to summarize a whole state. When a node proposes a block, the root of the post-state is included as metadata in the header. That means that after executing a block, we can calculate the root of the resulting post-state MPT and compare it with the metadata. If it matches, we have a cryptographic proof that both nodes arrived at the same conclusion.

This means that we will need to maintain both a snapshot (for efficient reads) and a trie (for efficient summaries) for every state in the blockchain. Here's an interesting blogpost by the go ethereum (geth) team explaining this need in detail: https://blog.ethereum.org/2020/07/17/ask-about-geth-snapshot-acceleration
