# Running Ethrex in Aligned Mode

This guide extends the [Deploy an L2 overview](./overview.md) and shows how to run an ethrex L2 with **Aligned mode** enabled.

> **For a comprehensive technical deep-dive into the Aligned integration architecture, see [Aligned Layer Integration](../fundamentals/ethrex_l2_aligned_integration.md).**

It assumes:

- You already installed the `ethrex` binary to your `$PATH` (for example from the repo root with `cargo install --locked --path cmd/ethrex --bin ethrex --features l2,l2-sql,sp1 --force`).
- You have the ethrex repository checked out locally for the `make` targets referenced below.

> **Important**: Aligned mode only supports **SP1 proofs**. The `sp1` feature must be enabled when building with Aligned mode.

- Check [How to Run (local devnet)](#how-to-run-local-devnet) for development or testing.
- Check [How to Run (testnet)](#how-to-run-testnet) for a prod-like environment.

## How to run (testnet)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This guide assumes there is an L1 running with all Aligned environment set.

### 1. Generate the prover ELF/VK

From the ethrex repository root run:

```bash
make -C crates/l2 build-prover-sp1 # optional: GPU=true
```

This will generate the SP1 ELF program and verification key under:

- `crates/l2/prover/src/guest_program/src/sp1/out/riscv32im-succinct-zkvm-elf`
- `crates/l2/prover/src/guest_program/src/sp1/out/riscv32im-succinct-zkvm-vk-u32`

### 2. Deploying L1 Contracts

Run the deployer with the Aligned settings:

```bash
COMPILE_CONTRACTS=true \
ETHREX_L2_ALIGNED=true \
ETHREX_DEPLOYER_ALIGNED_AGGREGATOR_ADDRESS=<ALIGNED_AGGREGATOR_ADDRESS> \
ETHREX_L2_SP1=true \
ETHREX_DEPLOYER_RANDOMIZE_CONTRACT_DEPLOYMENT=true \
ethrex l2 deploy \
  --eth-rpc-url <ETH_RPC_URL> \
  --private-key <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY> \
  --on-chain-proposer-owner <ON_CHAIN_PROPOSER_OWNER>  \
  --bridge-owner <BRIDGE_OWNER_ADDRESS>  \
  --genesis-l2-path fixtures/genesis/l2.json \
  --proof-sender.l1-address <PROOF_SENDER_L1_ADDRESS>
```

> [!NOTE]
> This command requires the `COMPILE_CONTRACTS` env variable to be set, as the deployer needs the SDK to embed the proxy bytecode.
> In this step we are initializing the `OnChainProposer` contract with the `ALIGNED_PROOF_AGGREGATOR_SERVICE_ADDRESS` and skipping the rest of verifiers; you can find the address for the aligned aggregator service [here](https://docs.alignedlayer.com/guides/7_contract_addresses).
> Save the addresses of the deployed proxy contracts, as you will need them to run the L2 node.
> Accounts for the deployer, on-chain proposer owner, bridge owner, and proof sender must have funds. Add `--bridge-owner-pk <PRIVATE_KEY>` if you want the deployer to immediately call `acceptOwnership` on behalf of that owner; otherwise, they can accept later.

### 3. Deposit funds to the `AggregationModePaymentService` contract from the proof sender

Aligned uses a quota-based payment model. You need to deposit ETH to obtain quota for proof submissions using the Aligned CLI.

First, clone the Aligned repository and build the CLI:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yetanotherco/aligned_layer.git
cd aligned_layer
git checkout 54ca2471624700536561b6bd369ed9f4d327991e
```

Then run the deposit command:

```bash
cd aggregation_mode/cli

cargo run --release -- deposit \
  --private-key <PROOF_SENDER_PRIVATE_KEY> \
  --network <NETWORK> \
  --rpc-url <RPC_URL>
```

Where `<NETWORK>` is one of: `devnet`, `hoodi`, or `mainnet`.

Example for Hoodi testnet:

```bash
cargo run --release -- deposit \
  --private-key 0x... \
  --network hoodi \
  --rpc-url https://ethereum-hoodi-rpc.publicnode.com
```

> **Note**: The deposit command sends a fixed amount of ETH (currently 0.0035 ETH) to the payment service contract. The contract addresses are automatically resolved based on the network parameter.

#### Monitoring Quota Balance

To check your remaining quota, you can query the `AggregationModePaymentService` contract directly:

```bash
# Get the payment service contract address for your network from Aligned docs
# Then query the quota balance for your proof sender address
cast call <PAYMENT_SERVICE_ADDRESS> "getQuota(address)(uint256)" <PROOF_SENDER_ADDRESS> --rpc-url <RPC_URL>
```

Monitor your quota balance regularly. When the L1ProofSender runs out of quota, you'll see `AlignedSubmitProofError` with an insufficient quota message in the logs. Deposit more funds before this happens to avoid proof submission failures.

### 4. Running a node

Run the sequencer using the installed `ethrex` binary:

```bash
ethrex l2 \
  --watcher.block-delay 0 \
  --network fixtures/genesis/l2.json \
  --l1.bridge-address <BRIDGE_ADDRESS> \
  --l1.timelock-address <TIMELOCK_ADDRESS> \
  --l1.on-chain-proposer-address <ON_CHAIN_PROPOSER_ADDRESS> \
  --eth.rpc-url <ETH_RPC_URL> \
  --aligned \
  --aligned-network <ALIGNED_NETWORK>  \
  --block-producer.coinbase-address <COINBASE_ADDRESS>  \
  --committer.l1-private-key <COMMITTER_PRIVATE_KEY>  \
  --proof-coordinator.l1-private-key <PROOF_COORDINATOR_PRIVATE_KEY>  \
  --aligned.beacon-url <ALIGNED_BEACON_URL> \
  --datadir ethrex_l2 \
  --no-monitor
```

Both committer and proof coordinator should have funds.

Aligned params explanation:

- `--aligned`: Enables aligned mode, enforcing all required parameters.
- `--aligned.beacon-url`: URL of the beacon client used by the Aligned SDK to verify proof aggregations, it has to support `/eth/v1/beacon/blobs`
- `--aligned-network`: Parameter used by the Aligned SDK. Available networks: `devnet`, `hoodi`, `mainnet`.
- `--aligned.from-block`: (Optional) Starting L1 block number for proof aggregation search. Helps avoid scanning old blocks from before proofs were being sent. If not set, the search starts from the beginning.

If you can't find a beacon client URL which supports that endpoint, you can run your own with lighthouse and ethrex:

Create secrets directory and jwt secret

```bash
mkdir -p ethereum/secrets/
openssl rand -hex 32 | tr -d "\n" | tee ./ethereum/secrets/jwt.hex
```

```bash
lighthouse bn --network <NETWORK> --execution-endpoint http://localhost:8551 --execution-jwt ./ethereum/secrets/jwt.hex --checkpoint-sync-url <CHECKPOINT_URL> --http --purge-db-force --supernode
```

```bash
ethrex --authrpc.jwtsecret ./ethereum/secrets/jwt.hex --network <NETWORK>
```

### 5. Running the Prover

In another terminal start the prover:

```bash
make -C crates/l2 init-prover-sp1 GPU=true # The GPU parameter is optional
```

Then you should wait until Aligned aggregates your proof. Note that proofs are typically aggregated every 24 hours.

## How to run (local devnet)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This guide assumes you have already generated the prover ELF/VK. See: [Generate the prover ELF/VK](#1-generate-the-prover-elfvk)

### Set Up the Aligned Environment

1. Clone the Aligned repository and checkout the tested revision:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:yetanotherco/aligned_layer.git
    cd aligned_layer
    git checkout 54ca2471624700536561b6bd369ed9f4d327991e
    ```

2. Edit the `aligned_layer/network_params.rs` file to send some funds to the `committer` and `integration_test` addresses:

    ```
    prefunded_accounts: '{
        "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266": { "balance": "100000000000000ETH" },
        "0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8": { "balance": "100000000000000ETH" },

        ...
        "0xa0Ee7A142d267C1f36714E4a8F75612F20a79720": { "balance": "100000000000000ETH" },
    +   "0x4417092B70a3E5f10Dc504d0947DD256B965fc62": { "balance": "100000000000000ETH" },
    +   "0x3d1e15a1a55578f7c920884a9943b3b35d0d885b": { "balance": "100000000000000ETH" },
         }'
    ```

    You can also decrease the seconds per slot in `aligned_layer/network_params.rs`:

    ```
    # Number of seconds per slot on the Beacon chain
      seconds_per_slot: 4
    ```

    Change `ethereum-genesis-generator` to 5.2.3

    ```
    ethereum_genesis_generator_params:
      # The image to use for ethereum genesis generator
      image: ethpandaops/ethereum-genesis-generator:5.2.3
    ```

3. Make sure you have the latest version of [kurtosis](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis) installed and start the ethereum-package:

    ```
    cd aligned_layer
    make ethereum_package_start
    ```

    If you need to stop it run `make ethereum_package_rm`

4. Start the payments poller (in a new terminal):

    ```bash
    cd aligned_layer
    make agg_mode_payments_poller_start_ethereum_package
    ```

    This starts PostgreSQL, runs migrations, and starts the payments poller.

5. Start the Aligned gateway (in a new terminal):

    ```bash
    cd aligned_layer
    make agg_mode_gateway_start_ethereum_package
    ```

    The gateway will listen on `http://127.0.0.1:8089`.

6. Build and start the proof aggregator in dev mode (in a new terminal):

    ```bash
    cd aligned_layer
    # Build the dev aggregator binary (uses mock proofs, no actual proving)
    AGGREGATOR=sp1 cargo build --manifest-path ./aggregation_mode/Cargo.toml --release --bin proof_aggregator_dev

    # Start the aggregator
    make proof_aggregator_start_dev_ethereum_package AGGREGATOR=sp1
    ```

    > **Note**: The dev mode aggregator uses mock proofs for faster iteration. For production-like testing, use `make proof_aggregator_start_ethereum_package SP1_PROVER=cuda AGGREGATOR=sp1` instead (requires more resources and a CUDA-capable GPU).

### Initialize L2 node

1. Deploy the L1 contracts, specifying the `AlignedProofAggregatorService` contract address:

    ```bash
    COMPILE_CONTRACTS=true \
    ETHREX_L2_ALIGNED=true \
    ETHREX_DEPLOYER_ALIGNED_AGGREGATOR_ADDRESS=0xcbEAF3BDe82155F56486Fb5a1072cb8baAf547cc \
    ETHREX_L2_SP1=true \
    make -C crates/l2 deploy-l1
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > This command requires the COMPILE_CONTRACTS env variable to be set, as the deployer needs the SDK to embed the proxy bytecode.

    You will see that some deposits fail with the following error:

    ```
    2025-10-13T19:44:51.600047Z ERROR ethrex::l2::deployer: Failed to deposit address=0x0002869e27c6faee08cca6b765a726e7a076ee0f value_to_deposit=0
    2025-10-13T19:44:51.600114Z  WARN ethrex::l2::deployer: Failed to make deposits: Deployer EthClient error: eth_sendRawTransaction request error: insufficient funds for gas * price + value: have 0 want 249957710190063
    ```

    This is because not all the accounts are pre-funded from the genesis.

2. Deposit funds to the AggregationModePaymentService contract from the proof sender using the Aligned CLI:

    ```bash
    # From the aligned_layer repository root
    cd aggregation_mode/cli

    cargo run --release -- deposit \
      --private-key 0x39725efee3fb28614de3bacaffe4cc4bd8c436257e2c8bb887c4b5c4be45e76d \
      --network devnet \
      --rpc-url http://localhost:8545
    ```

3. Start the L2 node:

    ```bash
    ETHREX_ALIGNED_MODE=true \
    ETHREX_ALIGNED_BEACON_URL=http://127.0.0.1:58801 \
    ETHREX_ALIGNED_NETWORK=devnet \
    ETHREX_PROOF_COORDINATOR_DEV_MODE=false \
    SP1=true \
    make -C crates/l2 init-l2
    ```

    Suggestion:
    When running the integration test, consider increasing the `--committer.commit-time` to 2 minutes. This helps avoid having to aggregate the proofs twice. You can do this by adding the following flag to the `init-l2-no-metrics` target:

    ```
    --committer.commit-time 120000
    ```

4. Start the SP1 prover in a different terminal:

    ```bash
    make -C crates/l2 init-prover-sp1 GPU=true # The GPU flag is optional
    ```

### Aggregate proofs:

After some time, you will see that the `l1_proof_verifier` is waiting for Aligned to aggregate the proofs. In production, proofs are typically aggregated every 24 hours. For local testing, the proof aggregator started in step 8 will process proofs automatically.

If the aggregator is not running or you need to trigger a new aggregation cycle, run:

```bash
cd aligned_layer
make proof_aggregator_start_dev_ethereum_package AGGREGATOR=sp1
```

This will reset the last aggregated block counter and start processing queued proofs.

If successful, the `l1_proof_verifier` will print the following logs:

```
INFO ethrex_l2::sequencer::l1_proof_verifier: Proof for batch 1 aggregated by Aligned with commitment 0xa9a0da5a70098b00f97d96cee43867c7aa8f5812ca5388da7378454580af2fb7 and Merkle root 0xa9a0da5a70098b00f97d96cee43867c7aa8f5812ca5388da7378454580af2fb7
INFO ethrex_l2::sequencer::l1_proof_verifier: Batches verified in OnChainProposer, with transaction hash 0x731d27d81b2e0f1bfc0f124fb2dd3f1a67110b7b69473cacb6a61dea95e63321
```

## Behavioral Differences in Aligned Mode

### Prover

- Generates `Compressed` proofs instead of `Groth16` (used in standard mode).
- Required because Aligned accepts compressed SP1 proofs.
- **Only SP1 proofs are supported** for Aligned mode.

> **Note**: RISC0 support is not currently available in Aligned's aggregation mode. The codebase retains RISC0 code paths (verifier IDs, merkle proof handling, contract logic) for future compatibility when Aligned re-enables RISC0 support.

### Proof Sender

- Sends proofs to the **Aligned Gateway** instead of directly to the `OnChainProposer` contract.
- Uses a quota-based payment model (requires depositing to the `AggregationModePaymentService` contract).
- Tracks the last proof sent using the rollup store.

![Proof Sender Aligned Mode](../img/aligned_mode_proof_sender.png)

### Proof Verifier

- Spawned only in Aligned mode (not used in standard mode).
- Monitors whether the next proof has been aggregated by Aligned using the `ProofAggregationServiceProvider`.
- Once verified, collects all already aggregated proofs and triggers the advancement of the `OnChainProposer` contract by sending a single transaction.

![Aligned Mode Proof Verifier](../img/aligned_mode_proof_verifier.png)

### OnChainProposer

- Uses `verifyBatchesAligned()` instead of `verifyBatch()` (used in standard mode).
- Receives an array of proofs to verify.
- Delegates proof verification to the `AlignedProofAggregatorService` contract.

## Supported Networks

The Aligned SDK supports the following networks:

| Network | Chain ID | Gateway URL |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Mainnet | 1 | `https://mainnet.gateway.alignedlayer.com` |
| Hoodi | 560048 | `https://hoodi.gateway.alignedlayer.com` |
| Devnet | 31337 | `http://127.0.0.1:8089` |
