# Deposits

This document contains a detailed explanation of how asset deposits work.

## Native ETH deposits

This section explains step by step how native ETH deposits work.

On L1:

1. The user sends ETH to the `CommonBridge` contract.
   Alternatively, they can also call `deposit` and specify the address to receive the deposit in (the `l2Recipient`).
2. The bridge adds the deposit's hash to the `pendingTxHashes`.
   We explain how to compute this hash in ["Generic L1->L2 messaging"](#generic-l1-l2-messaging)
3. The bridge emits a `PrivilegedTxSent` event:

    ```solidity
    bytes memory callData = abi.encodeCall(ICommonBridgeL2.mintETH, (l2Recipient));

    emit PrivilegedTxSent(
        0xffff,         // sender in L2 (the L2 bridge)
        0xffff,         // to (the L2 bridge)
        transactionId,
        msg.value,      // value
        gasLimit,
        callData
    );
    ```

Off-chain:

1. On each L2 node, the L1 watcher processes `PrivilegedTxSent` events, each adding a `PrivilegedL2Transaction` to the L2 mempool.
2. The privileged transaction is an [EIP-2718 typed transaction](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718), somewhat similar to an [EIP-1559 transaction](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559), but with some changes.
   For this case, the important difference is that the sender of the transaction is set by our L1 bridge.
   This enables our L1 bridge to "forge" transactions from any sender, even arbitrary addresses like the L2 bridge.
3. Privileged transactions sent by the L2 bridge don't deduct from the bridge's balance their value.
   In practice, this means ETH equal to the transaction's `value` is minted.

On L2:

1. The privileged transaction calls `mintETH` on the `CommonBridgeL2` with the intended recipient as parameter.
2. The bridge verifies the sender is itself, which can only happen for deposits sent through the L1 bridge.
3. The bridge sends the minted ETH to the recipient.
   In case of failure, it initiates an ETH withdrawal for the same amount.

Back on L1:

1. A sequencer commits a batch on L1 including the privileged transaction.
2. The `OnChainProposer` asserts the included privileged transactions exist and are included in order.
3. The `OnChainProposer` notifies the bridge of the consumed privileged transactions and they are removed from `pendingTxHashes`.

## ERC20 deposits through the native bridge

This section explains step by step how native ERC20 deposits work.

On L1:

1. The user gives the `CommonBridge` allowance via an `approve` call to the L1 token contract.
2. The user calls `depositERC20` on the bridge, specifying the L1 and L2 token addresses, the amount to deposit, along with the intended L2 recipient.
3. The bridge locks the specified L1 token amount in the bridge, updating the mapping with the amount locked for the L1 and L2 token pair.
   This ensures that L2 token withdrawals don't consume L1 tokens that weren't deposited into that L2 token (see ["Why store the provenance of bridged tokens?"](#why-store-the-provenance-of-bridged-tokens) for more information).
4. The bridge emits a `PrivilegedTxSent` event:

    ```solidity
    emit PrivilegedTxSent(
        0,            // amount (unused)
        0xffff,       // to (the L2 bridge)
        depositId,
        0xffff,       // sender in L2 (the L2 bridge)
        gasLimit,
        callData
    );
    ```

Off-chain:

1. On each L2 node, the L1 watcher processes `PrivilegedTxSent` events, each adding a `PrivilegedL2Transaction` to the L2 mempool.
2. The privileged transaction is an [EIP-2718 typed transaction](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718), somewhat similar to an [EIP-1559 transaction](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559), but with some changes.
   For this case, the important difference is that the sender of the transaction is set by our L1 bridge.
   This enables our L1 bridge to "forge" transactions from any sender, even arbitrary addresses like the L2 bridge.

On L2:

1. The privileged transaction performs a call to `mintERC20` on the `CommonBridgeL2` from the L2 bridge's address, specifying the address of the L1 and L2 tokens, along with the amount and recipient.
2. The bridge verifies the sender is itself, which can only happen for deposits sent through the L1 bridge.
3. The bridge calls `l1Address()` on the L2 token, to verify it matches the received L1 token address.
4. The bridge calls `crosschainMint` on the L2 token, minting the specified amount of tokens and sending them to the L2 recipient.
   In case of failure, it initiates an ERC20 withdrawal for the same amount.

Back on L1:

1. A sequencer commits a batch on L1 including the privileged transaction.
2. The `OnChainProposer` asserts the included privileged transactions exist and are included in order.
3. The `OnChainProposer` notifies the bridge of the consumed privileged transactions and they are removed from `pendingTxHashes`.

### Why store the provenance of bridged tokens?

As said before, storing the provenance of bridged tokens or, in other words, how many tokens were sent from each L1 token to each L2 token, ensures that L2 token withdrawals don't unlock L1 tokens that weren't deposited into another L2 token.

This can be better understood with an example:

```mermaid

title: Attacker exploits alternative bridge without token provenance

sequenceDiagram
    box rgb(33,66,99) L1
        actor L1Eve as Eve
        actor L1Alice as Alice
        participant CommonBridge
    end

    box rgb(139, 63, 63) L2
        participant CommonBridgeL2
        actor L2Alice as Alice
        actor L2Eve as Eve
    end

    Note over L1Eve,L2Eve: Alice does a normal deposit
    L1Alice ->> CommonBridge: Deposits 100 Foo tokens into FooL2
    CommonBridge -->> CommonBridgeL2: Notifies deposit
    CommonBridgeL2 ->> L2Alice: Sends 100 FooL2 tokens

    Note over L1Eve,L2Eve: Eve does a deposit to ensure the L2 token they control is registered with the bridge
    L1Eve ->> CommonBridge: Deposits 1 Foo token into Bar
    CommonBridge -->> CommonBridgeL2: Notifies deposit
    CommonBridgeL2 ->> L2Eve: Sends 1 Bar token

    Note over L1Eve,L2Eve: Eve does a malicious withdrawal of Alice's funds
    L2Eve ->> CommonBridgeL2: Withdraws 101 Bar tokens into Foo
    CommonBridgeL2 -->> CommonBridge: Notifies withdrawal
    CommonBridge ->> L1Eve: Sends 101 Foo tokens
```

## Generic L1->L2 messaging

<!-- TODO: extend this version once we have generic L1->L2 messages -->

Privileged transactions are signaled by the L1 bridge through `PrivilegedTxSent` events.
These events are emitted by the `CommonBridge` contract on L1 and processed by the L1 watcher on each L2 node.

```solidity
event PrivilegedTxSent (
    address indexed from,
    address indexed to,
    uint256 indexed transactionId,
    uint256 value,
    uint256 gasLimit,
    bytes data
);
```

As seen before, this same event is used for native deposits, but with the `from` artificially set to the L2 bridge address, which is also the `to` address.

For tracking purposes, we might want to know the hash of the L2 transaction.
We can compute it as follows:

```solidity
keccak256(
    bytes.concat(
        bytes20(from),
        bytes20(to),
        bytes32(transactionId),
        bytes32(value),
        bytes32(gasLimit),
        keccak256(data)
    )
)
```

## Address Aliasing

To prevent attacks where a L1 impersonates an L2 contract, we implement Address Aliasing [like Optimism](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/differences#address-aliasing) (albeit with a different constant, to prevent confusion).

The attack prevented would've looked like this:
- An L2 contract gets deployed at address A
- Someone malicious deploys a contract at the same address (through deterministic deployments, etc)
- The malicious contract sends a privileged transaction, which can steal A's resources on the L2

By modifying the address of L1 contracts by adding a constant, we prevent this attack since both won't have the same address.

## Forced Inclusion

Each transaction is given a deadline for processing. If the sequencer is unwilling to include a privileged transaction before this timer expires, batches stop being processed and the chain halts until the sequencer processes every expired transaction.

After an extended downtime, the sequencer can catch up by sending batches made solely out of privileged transactions.

```mermaid

sequenceDiagram
    box rgb(33,66,99) L1
        actor L1Alice
        actor Sequencer
        participant CommonBridge
        participant OnChainProposer
    end

    L1Alice ->> CommonBridge: Sends a privileged transaction

    Note over Sequencer: Sequencer goes offline for a long time
    Sequencer ->> OnChainProposer: Sends batch as usual
    OnChainProposer ->> Sequencer: Error
    Note over Sequencer: Operator configures the sequencer to catch up
    Sequencer ->> OnChainProposer: Sends batch of only privileged transactions
    OnChainProposer ->> Sequencer: OK
    Sequencer ->> OnChainProposer: Sends batch with remaining expired privileged transactions, along with other transactions
    OnChainProposer ->> Sequencer: OK
    Note over Sequencer: Sequencer is now caught up
    Sequencer ->> OnChainProposer: Sends batch as usual
    OnChainProposer ->> Sequencer: OK
```

## Limitations

Due to the gas cost of computing rolling hashes, there is a limit to how many deposits can be handled in a single batch.  
To prevent the creation of invalid batches, we enforce a maximum cap on deposits per batch in the `l1_committer`.  
We also enforce the same maximum cap per block in the `block_producer`, to avoid situations where the `l1_committer` could get stuck if a single block contains more deposits than the configured batch cap.
